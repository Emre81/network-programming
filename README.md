### How to execuate server?
Our project is an Node.js project so in normally you have to load node_modules files for dependencies. But when I load the files I uploaded node_modules files already so you don't need to install anything.

You can clone the github repository to run the project on your computer:
 
        git clone https://github.com/Emre81/network-programming
        
After the cloning process enter the project's folder from terminal screen and type the code below:
  
        node index.js
        
Now you can reach the server using browser with localhost:3000 address.
